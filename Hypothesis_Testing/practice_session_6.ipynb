    "\n",
    "So far, all the hypothesis tests we have used assumed that the data were **normally distributed**.  \n",
    "But what if that assumption does not hold?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why data might **not follow a normal distribution**.\\\n",
    "As we already saw in **Practice Session 2**, environmental data often follow **log-normal**, **exponential**, or other **skewed** distributions.\\\n",
    "In some cases, a **data transformation** (for example, log-transform) can make the data approximately normal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, non-normality can also arise from the presence of **outliers**, which can introduce or increase skewness in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A quick reminder: what is skewness?**\\\n",
    "**Skewness** measures how asymmetric a distribution is relative to the mean:\n",
    "- A **positive skew** (right-skewed) means a longer tail on the **right** side (e.g., most values are small, but a few are much larger).  \n",
    "- A **negative skew** (left-skewed) means a longer tail on the **left** side (e.g., most values are large, but a few are much smaller).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In **Homework 1**, you already calculated the **sample skewness** and **excess kurtosis** of your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How much skewness or kurtosis is \"acceptable\"?**\\\n",
    "In practice, **small deviations from normality are usually not a problem** - most parametric tests, such as the *t*-test, are fairly robust to mild non-normality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are commonly used **rule-of-thumb thresholds** for interpreting **skewness**:\n",
    "| Distribution shape | Skewness range | Interpretation |\n",
    "|:---|:---:|:---|\n",
    "| Approximately normal | −0.5 to +0.5 | Distribution is close to symmetric |\n",
    "| Moderately skewed | −1 to −0.5 or +0.5 to +1 | Noticeable asymmetry |\n",
    "| Highly skewed | ≤ −1 or ≥ +1 | Strong asymmetry, non-normal |\n",
    "\n",
    "For **excess kurtosis**, values between **−0.5 and +0.5** are typically considered *close to normal* (that is, the distribution’s tails and peak resemble those of a normal curve.)\n",
