#### Accuracy
Accuracy is a measure of how often a predictive model correctly predicts the outcome. In a two-class problem, it is defined as the ratio of the number of times a machine learning model correctly recognizes events of the two classes with respect to all events in the dataset.

#### Alternative hypothesis
When trying to understand the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable, the alternative hypothesis is the claim that there is such an effect. Researchers use a statistical test to weigh evidence for or against the alternative hypothesis.

#### ANOVA
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical method used to determine if there are statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups by analyzing the variation within each group compared to the variation between the groups.

#### API
An application programming interface (API) is a software intermediary that allows two software applications to communicate with each other, enabling data exchange.

#### Bar chart
A bar chart is a graphical representation of categorical data using rectangular bars, where the length of each bar corresponds to the value it represents. It is commonly used for displaying category frequency, comparing different categories, or tracking changes in values over time.

#### Bayesian statistics
Bayesian statistics is a branch of statistics that uses probability to represent uncertainty in statistical models and updates these probabilities as new data becomes available. It incorporates prior knowledge or beliefs to refine predictions and decision-making.
