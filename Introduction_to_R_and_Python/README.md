### R or Python?

If you want opinions, the internet is full of blog posts, videos, and forum threads debating which language to use for data science: `R` or `Python` (a few curated links: [What others think: Python or R?](#what-others-think-python-or-r))
Additionally, this document covers some background, key facts, and the main strengths and trade-offs for both.

However, in this course, you‚Äôre free to use either **`R`** or **`Python`**. 
Both are powerful and widely used for environmental data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
Before you decide (and yes, you can use both), we‚Äôll spend the first two days covering the ABCs of each language so you can test-drive them and see which feels right.

And if you care about my opinion: an **exceptional environmental data scientist** benefits from knowing **both**.
If you have the time, I fully support learning both. 
You‚Äôll see plenty of shared concepts, and once the programming fundamentals click, switching between them isn‚Äôt that hard. 
At a minimum, aim to **learn the one most common in your subfield**. You‚Äôll get a feel for that during your thesis project and courses by watching what researchers actually use.

> üßë‚Äçüè´ *In this course, we use Jupyter Notebooks as a shared platform. You can work with either language ‚Äî we will guide you through setting up both!*


# üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Your Tools: IDEs, Environments, and Notebooks

Once you've chosen between **R** and **Python**, it's time to set up your development tools. This guide will walk you through:

- What is an IDE?
- What is an environment and why it matters
- What is a kernel?
- How to set up Anaconda environments
- How to use Jupyter Notebooks (with both R and Python)
- Using Google Colab (for those who don‚Äôt want to install anything)

---

## üíª What Is an IDE?

**IDE** stands for **Integrated Development Environment**. It‚Äôs a software application that makes coding easier by combining:

- A code editor
- A debugger
- A terminal or console
- File management tools
- Package management (in some cases)

### Common IDEs:
| Language | IDE | Link |
|---------|-----|------|
| Python | [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) | Fast, extensible, modern |
| R | [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) | Tailored for R scripting, modeling, and reporting |
| Both | [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/), [Rodeo](https://rodeo.yhat.com/) | Notebook-based environments |

---

## üß™ What Is an Environment?

An **environment** is a self-contained workspace with:

- A specific version of a programming language
- A set of libraries or packages
- Its own interpreter or kernel

### Why use environments?
- Prevents **version conflicts** between projects
- Keeps your machine organized
- Essential for reproducibility and collaboration

We recommend using **[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)** to manage environments for this course.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Creating Environments with Anaconda

### üîπ For Python:

```bash
conda create -n dataenv_python python=3.11
conda activate dataenv_python
conda install jupyter pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### üîπ For R:

```bash
conda create -n dataenv_r r-essentials r-base
conda activate dataenv_r
conda install -c r r-irkernel
```

**Tip:** Use the Anaconda Navigator UI if you‚Äôre not comfortable with the command line.

---

## üß† What Is a Kernel?

A **kernel** is the computational engine behind a notebook or IDE. It interprets your code, runs it, and returns results.

- In **Jupyter**, the kernel is language-specific (R or Python)
- You can switch kernels using the toolbar in Jupyter or JupyterLab

---

## üìÉ What Are Notebooks?

**Notebooks** are interactive documents where you can write code, view output, and add text or math explanations.

| Tool | Notebook Format | Language |
|------|------------------|----------|
| Jupyter Notebook | `.ipynb` | Python, R, Julia, etc. |
| R Markdown | `.Rmd` | R |

> üìå In this course, **Jupyter Notebooks** will be the standard for both R and Python. You‚Äôre free to convert `.ipynb` notebooks to `.Rmd` if needed.

---

## üß™ How to Launch Jupyter Notebook

### 1. Activate your environment:

```bash
conda activate dataenv_python   # or dataenv_r
```

### 2. Launch Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### 3. Create a new notebook:
- Select your preferred kernel from the dropdown (Python 3 or R)

---

## üåê Google Colab ‚Äì The No-Install Option

**Google Colab** is a cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebook platform. It requires no setup, just a Google account.

### ‚úÖ Pros:
- No installation
- GPU/TPU support
- Easy to share

### ‚ùå Cons:
- Internet required
- Not ideal for R (requires workaround)
- Files are temporary unless saved to Drive

### üîπ Getting Started:

1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Choose ‚ÄúNew Notebook‚Äù
3. To enable R, go to `Runtime > Change Runtime Type > R`

> üìç You may need to install R packages manually each time, since Colab resets your environment on restart.
