## 🔹 Origins & History

### **R: Built for Statisticians**
- Developed in the **early 1990s** by **Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman** at the University of Auckland.
- Based on **S**, a statistical language from Bell Labs (1970s).
- Originally designed for **academic statisticians**, R is now the default tool in many scientific disciplines.

### **Python: General-Purpose to Data Science Giant**
- Created in **1991** by **Guido van Rossum** in the Netherlands.
- Named after *Monty Python's Flying Circus* 🎭 — not the snake!
- Originally a general-purpose language, Python exploded in popularity due to its readability and use in web, AI, and data science.
