### R or Python?

If you want opinions, the internet is full of blog posts, videos, and forum threads debating which language to use for data science: `R` or `Python` (a few curated links: [What others think: Python or R?](#what-others-think-python-or-r))
Additionally, this document covers some background, key facts, and the main strengths and trade-offs for both.

However, in this course, youâ€™re free to use either **`R`** or **`Python`**. 
Both are powerful and widely used for environmental data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
Before you decide (and yes, you can use both), weâ€™ll spend the first two days covering the ABCs of each language so you can test-drive them and see which feels right.

And if you care about my opinion: an **exceptional environmental data scientist** benefits from knowing **both**.
If you have the time, I fully support learning both. 
Youâ€™ll see plenty of shared concepts, and once the programming fundamentals click, switching between them isnâ€™t that hard. 
At a minimum, aim to **learn the one most common in your subfield**. Youâ€™ll get a feel for that during your thesis project and courses by watching what researchers actually use.

## Origins & History

### <img width="50" alt="r" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/2560px-R_logo.svg.png" />: built for statisticians
- Developed in the **early 1990s** by [**Ross Ihaka**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka) and [**Robert Gentleman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician)) at the University of Auckland.
- Inspired by **S**, the statistical language created at Bell Labs in the 1970s.
- Designed first for **academic statisticians**; today itâ€™s a go-to tool across many scientific disciplines.
- 22,676 packages on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)

- Started by [**Guido van Rossum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) (webpage: https://gvanrossum.github.io/) in **1989** (famously as a holiday project).
- Named after *Monty Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus*, not the snake.
- Began as a **general-purpose** language focused on readability; later exploded in web, AI/ML, and data science thanks to its rich ecosystem.
- Today, Python **consistently ranks at or near the top** of programming-language popularity indices (https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/, https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html, https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/technology).
- 665,810 packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org)
