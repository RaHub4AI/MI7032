# Computing Environment Setup

In this course, we will use [`Jupyter notebooks`](https://jupyter.org/) in [`Google Colaboratory`](https://colab.research.google.com/) as the default environment for both `R` and `Python`.  
If you prefer to run notebooks locally on your own computer, you are welcome to do so. During the first workshop, we will demonstrate how to set up local environments.
$\color{gold}{\textsf{However, please note that if you choose to work locally, you are fully responsible for resolving any installation problems,}}$
$\color{gold}{\textsf{dependency issues, or package conflicts that may occur.}}$

Colab is a free, browser-based Jupyter environment provided by Google. We use Colab because:
- It runs entirely in the **cloud** (no installation is needed for most exercises).  
- All students work in the **same runtime environment**, with free access to computing resources (including GPUs and TPUs).  
- Notebooks are easy to **share, collaborate on, and reproduce**.  
- It supports both **Python** and **R**.  
- It ensures a consistent setup, making it easier for teachers to run labs smoothly for everyone.

Jupyter Notebooks are interactive documents that combine **code, text, equations, and visualizations** in a single file. We use notebooks in this course because:  
- They provide an **interactive coding environment** ideal for learning and exploration.  
- Code and results appear together, making workflows **transparent and reproducible**.  
- Support for both **Python** and **R** (and many other languages via kernels).  
- Notebooks can be run in different environments, e.g., in the **cloud with Colab** or **locally on your computer**.  
- Widely used in science and data analysis, so learning them builds transferable skills.
