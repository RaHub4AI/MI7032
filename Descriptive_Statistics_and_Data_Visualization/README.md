#  Additional Reading & Study Materials

Here are some materials you can read to deepen your understanding of the covered topics:


- **Main Reading**
  
  **Learning Statistics with R** by Danielle Navarro  
  [https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/)  

  The same material is also available for **Python** users:  
  [https://ethanweed.github.io/pythonbook/landingpage.html](https://ethanweed.github.io/pythonbook/landingpage.html)


- **How *Not* to Visualize Data**
  
  For fun (and to learn what to avoid), check this **Wikipedia article** on misleading or confusing charts:
  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misleading_graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misleading_graph)
  It shows classic examples of how visual design choices can distort information — useful for critical data literacy!

- Moments of Data
  
  If you’re interested in the **mathematical side** of describing data (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, etc.), this short article gives a clear overview:

> * You don’t need to read all of this at once! These are materials for you to explore at your own pace as we move through the course.*
