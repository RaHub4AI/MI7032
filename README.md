## üìñ Course Overview
In the emerging era of *big data*, natural and social scientists must be able to rapidly interpret, analyze, and visualize data to answer targeted research questions.  

This course introduces **open-source tools** for modern data analysis in **R** and **Python** using real-world environmental datasets on climate change, pollution, and biodiversity. Through lectures, workshops, and hands-on labs, you will learn complete workflows: from **data import and cleaning** to **statistical analysis, visualization, and modeling**.

By the end of the course, you will be able to:
- Select and apply appropriate **statistical methods** for environmental data.
- Perform **descriptive statistics**, **hypothesis testing**, and **regression analysis** in R and/or Python.
- Use **data visualization** techniques to clearly communicate results.
- Apply methods to real environmental research problems.
