## Course Overview
In the emerging era of *big data*, natural and social scientists must be able to rapidly interpret, analyze, and visualize data to answer targeted research questions.  

This course introduces **open-source tools** for modern data analysis in **R** and **Python** using real-world environmental datasets on climate change, pollution, and biodiversity. Through lectures, workshops, and hands-on labs, you will learn complete workflows: from **data import and cleaning** to **statistical analysis, visualization, and modeling**.

By the end of the course, you will be able to:
- Select and apply appropriate **statistical methods** for environmental data.
- Perform **descriptive statistics**, **hypothesis testing**, and **regression analysis** in R and/or Python.
- Use **data visualization** techniques to clearly communicate results.
- Apply methods to real environmental research problems.

### Attendance
Attendance is not compulsory. But we encourage students to participate physically if there is a possibility.

### Deadlines
All deadlines in this course are **strict**. Submissions are timestamped automatically:  
- Even being **1 minute late** counts as **1 full late day**.  
- Each late day reduces the assignment score by **10% of the maximum points**.  
  - Example: if a homework is worth 10 points, the penalty is **–1 point per late day**.

### Grading requirements
- Part 1 (5 ECTS): assessed via homeworks (4 in total)
- Part 2 (2.5 ECTS): Assessed via take-home exam

Grading scale: A, B, C, D, E, Fx, F

### Academic Integrity & Use of Generative Tools
All homework submissions are **checked for plagiarism**.  
You may be tempted to use **ChatGPT or other generative AI tools** to help with assignments. This is reasonable in 2025; however, please note the following important caveats:
1. **Hallucinations:** LLMs can invent terms, formulas, algorithms, code, or calculations due to their auto-regressive nature.  
2. **Confident errors:** They often mix up concepts and present them confidently. Always verify any claims or ideas against independent sources (e.g., lecture slides or recommended readings).  
3. **Memory limitations:** Free versions may have limited memory, so the model might forget or ignore earlier parts of your conversation.  
4. **Code vs. understanding:** Generative AI can provide code, but blindly copying it will **not help you learn**. Use AI assistants to **debug or clarify**, not to solve exercises from scratch. You will learn much more by working independently.

**Responsibility:** If you use generative models, it is your responsibility to prevent these risks. Submitted text and code will be checked for **logical errors, misconceptions, and fabricated content**.
